# Digital-signal-labs
This repo consists of all the MATLAB signal processing lab exercises. Each of the tutorial covers the following experiments:
- Tutorial-2: Time-domain analysis of signals and systems
- Tutorial-3: Frequency domain representation of discrete-time signals â€“ DFS, DTFT, DFT
- Tutorial-4: Design of FIR filters using windowing, frequency sampling technique
- Tutorial-5: Design of IIR filters using Butterworth, Chebyshev, Elliptical approximations, and direct method.
